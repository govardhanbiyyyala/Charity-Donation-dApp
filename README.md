Charity Donation dApp â€“ Project Description

A Charity Donation dApp is a blockchain-based decentralized application designed to make the process of donating funds more transparent, secure, and trustworthy. Traditional donation systems often suffer from issues like lack of transparency, delayed fund transfers, and misuse of contributions. By using blockchain technology, every donation is recorded on an immutable public ledger, ensuring that donors can verify where their funds go.

This dApp allows users (donors) to directly send cryptocurrency (e.g., ETH) to a smart contract, which securely holds the funds. The contract keeps track of:

Who donated

How much was donated

When it was donated

Only the contract owner (charity organization) can withdraw the funds, ensuring accountability. Additionally, anyone can view donation records on-chain, making the process fully transparent and tamper-proof.

The vision behind this project is to rebuild trust in charitable organizations by leveraging decentralization, immutability, and transparency offered by blockchain technology.
